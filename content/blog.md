                  <p>I would like my portfolio to highlight my ability to apply core programming concepts in a simple, clean, intuitive way. I would like to show an understanding of database principles and  API design and usage. I would like it to emphasize performance and readability. I would also like it to show my instincts in product management which means the projects represent useful ideas and features and don’t seem too busy. I’d like the portfolio to also show my ability to combine various technologies.</p>

                  <p>I want to be creative, but finding inspiration and retaining focus long enough to truly create something is a challenge. It is hard to define achievable meaningful milestones, and to avoid the trap of the trying to achieve perfection. It seems like all creative projects have perfection pitfalls along the path to completion. I guess that is why it is so satisfying on the rare occurences that I can navigate that path successfully.</p>

                  <p>No? OK, nevermind then. It seems very difficult get rid of bad habits and reinforce good habits in my own life, but very easy to harp on my kids about doing the same. Should I let my kids figure out their own way and instead focus on my own issues? There doesn't seem to be enough time for both.</p>

It has been around for over 20 years and is one of the fastest growing languages today.</p>
